  ` + this.project.name + ` also creates an ever-increasing price floor, increasing ` + this.project.tokenName + `'s price consistently overtime.
  
  ` + this.project.name + ` is the backbone of a much larger ecosystem, with each project providing unique utility to BSC.`,

  A fee is taken from the tokens being unwrapped, this fee is permanently locked, creating an ever increasing price floor.

  This fee that gets permanently locked, resulting in a price floor, increases the price of ` + this.project.tokenName + ` consistently over time.`,

  These "farmers" and "stakers" are then rewarded for locking up their tokens. Their tokens are not permanently locked. They earn rewards for every second their tokens are placed in the ` + this.project.tokenName + ` ` + this.project.vaultName +  `.
  
  The protocol does not need to mint new tokens to reward farmers. The protocol is designed to provide an inflationless, sustainable and safe method of generating yield through taxing a portion of each trade, and providing it to those currently farming.`,

  Though on the ` + this.project.networkName + ` this causes a hurdle due to the lack of safe and reputable protocols. Our first ` + this.project.vaultName + ` will interact with Pancakeswap, with community voting to guide the team towards integrating more projects.`,

  Simply put, by porting to ` + this.project.networkName + `, ` + this.project.name + ` is already improving upon the mechanics of CORE. We will be the first team to move the cVault Finance team's revolutionary protocol to the ` + this.project.networkName + `.

  This is only a start to the changes we're making.
  
  You will be able to unwrap liquidity after a set time! No longer will you be worried about having permanently wrapped liquidity tokens. ` + this.project.lpTokenName + ` tokens give you just that, piece of mind.
  
  There will be VIP pools, where you must stake a certain amount of ` + this.project.tokenName + ` to participate in the farming of these pools.`,
